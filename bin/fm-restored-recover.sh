# fm-restored-recover.sh - put this home's restored workers back where their
# work is, after a machine restart.
#
# Usage: fm-restored-recover.sh [--dry-run]
#        fm-restored-recover.sh --background
#
# WHY. Herdr persists its session layout and, on restart, resumes each pane's
# recorded agent session (`claude --resume <id>`) in the pane's saved cwd. That
# cwd is the pane's TOP shell's directory, and a ship or scout pane's top shell
# sits in the project's primary checkout: `treehouse get` enters the task
# worktree in a nested shell, and no cd typed into that nested shell, nor an OSC 7
# report, reaches the saved layout (docs/verification/runtime-backends.md
# "Herdr restart resumes agents in the top shell's directory"). So after a
# reboot a worker comes back alive but in the primary checkout, where Claude
# Code often parks it on a startup gate such as the external CLAUDE.md imports
# consent. Nothing about that state is visible as `dead` or `missing`, so the
# ordinary dead-endpoint recovery never fires.
#
# WHAT. For every local direct report recorded in this home (ship, scout, or
# secondmate) on a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state classifier (tmux,
# herdr), whose agent reads `alive`, this sweep relaunches it through
# `bin/fm-control.sh <id> relaunch` when either holds:
#   - its viewport shows a harness startup gate (fm_composer_startup_dialog), or
#   - on Herdr, its harness process runs outside its recorded worktree, read
#     twice a moment apart so a transient read cannot trigger it. The directory is the
#     attributed harness pid's own (fm_backend_agent_pids; /proc/<pid>/cwd, or
#     lsof on macOS), so a command the agent runs elsewhere never counts; the
#     endpoint's foreground path stands in only when no pid's can be read.
# Drift counts only on Herdr, whose relaunch moves the pane back into the
# worktree; a tmux server does not survive a restart, so a tmux endpoint
# outside its worktree is not a restored worker and is left alone. A drifted
# Herdr endpoint with no startup gate on screen is relaunched only once Herdr
# reads the agent idle, so a working turn is never interrupted: a verdict that
# reads unknown is re-read like an unreadable endpoint below, and one that never
# settles idle is reported rather than relaunched.
# The relaunch owns everything else: the checkpoint that proves the worktree and
# its unlanded work are intact, stopping the old agent without answering any
# gate, entering the recorded worktree, and launching the replacement there
# with a progress note appended to the worker's instructions. A secondmate's
# charter is never rewritten, so its note stays parent-side evidence.
# Relaunches run concurrently, and each worker's line is published the moment
# that worker is settled, never held back until the slowest one finishes.
#
# Every other state is left alone: `dead` and `missing` endpoints keep their own
# recovery paths (the secondmate liveness sweep and stuck-crewmate recovery),
# and an unreadable path, an unreadable viewport, or any non-`alive` verdict
# never triggers a relaunch. Remote secondmates are skipped by name.
# An endpoint that reads `unreadable` is not given up on at once, because Herdr
# reports a just-resumed agent as `unknown` for a moment, and after a reboot the
# primary resumes at the same instant as its workers: the sweep re-reads it every
# FM_RESTORED_RECOVER_SETTLE_POLL seconds (default 3) for up to
# FM_RESTORED_RECOVER_SETTLE seconds (default 60) and goes on with whatever
# definite verdict it reaches. One still unreadable after that is reported, so
# a worker the sweep could not check never passes silently.
#
# OUTPUT, one line per affected task, nothing for a healthy fleet:
#   BOOTSTRAP_INFO: worker <id> was <cause>; relaunched in its recorded worktree <path>
#   RESTORED_WORKER: <id>: was <cause>; relaunch failed: <first error line>
#   RESTORED_WORKER: <id>: was <cause>; not relaunched: its agent read <busy|unknown>, not idle
#   RESTORED_WORKER: <id>: was <cause>; not relaunched (dry run)
#   RESTORED_WORKER: <id>: its endpoint stayed unreadable for <n>s, so it was not checked
#   RESTORED_WORKER: sweep: <why the sweep itself did not run or finish>
# Exit status is 0 unless the home itself cannot be read or a background job
# cannot be started. Only one sweep runs per home at a time (a lock under
# state/); a second one reports that and does nothing.
#
# MODES. Bare (or --dry-run, which flags but never relaunches) runs the sweep
# in the foreground and prints each line as it is settled; an operator may run
# it by hand from the lock-owning session, since each relaunch also takes
# fm-control's per-task lock and a healthy worker is a no-op.
# --background is how bin/fm-bootstrap.sh runs it from its deferred locked
# network phase: it starts the sweep as its own detached job and returns at
# once, printing nothing. A relaunch can legitimately outlast the deferred
# stage's aggregate deadline, and a deadline that killed it mid-transaction
# would leave the worker with no agent, so the job runs outside that stage's
# process group and deadline, under its own bound FM_RESTORED_RECOVER_TIMEOUT
# (default 300s, sized for fm-control's TERM and KILL waits plus its launch
# wait, all relaunches running concurrently). Each job writes its own results
# file, state/.restored-recover.results.<UTC timestamp>.<job pid>, line by line
# as each worker is settled, appends a `RESTORED_WORKER: sweep:` line if its
# bound expired, and enqueues one `check: restored-workers` wake naming that
# exact file whenever any line there is actionable (anything but
# BOOTSTRAP_INFO); a clean sweep stays silent. A later job never rewrites an
# earlier job's file; only the newest five results files are kept.
